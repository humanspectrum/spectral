Medium: [exercise story](https://medium.com/humanspectrum/exercise-the-circle-of-debunking-8cf31dadd0a4).

## Instruction

1. Take a list of paper and a pen.
2. Write down 4–5 personal attributes that make you unique or that are a core part of your character or personality.
3. In 2 minutes per each attribute: write down some realistic events that might lead you to lose your abilities or will make them irrelevant or not so unique.
4. Reflect on the events list. How your life would change if that really will happen? Are you able to prevent or mitigate them?

### Group variation (recommended): 

1. Give a list of paper and a pen to each person.
2. Ask everyone to write down 4–5 personal attributes that make them unique or that are a core part of their character or personality.
3. Circle: pass the list with attributes to the next person, get a similar list from the previous one.
4. In 3 minutes: each member of the group writes down the ideas for their current list, trying to write a least one event for each attribute. No event repeats are allowed.
5. Repeat the process from step 3. Finish when you get your list back.
6. Reflect on your events list. How your life would change if that really will happen? Are you able to prevent or mitigate them?

## Example

1. I’m good at seeing the big picture [after processing a significant amount of information]. 
*Event: there are narrow time constraints, that excludes processing all the information.*
*Outcome: the picture will be fragmented.*

2. I’m 2 meters tall in a country with 1.7m average.
*Event: you broke your legs.*
*Outcome: you’re 1 meter tall for 2–3 months.*
*Event: you moved to a country of a tall nation like the Netherlands.*
*Outcome: I’m now like everyone around.*

3. I’m able to inspire and motivate people.
*Event: you are now in a depression.*
*Outcome: no, you can’t.*
*Event: you failed people trust by doing something terrible.*
*Outcome: no one trusts you.*
