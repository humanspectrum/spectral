# Module H

The *H* module of the Spectral Thinking corpus is focused on personal usage of the methodology, and thus is all about humans, their attributes and their variability.

## Goals

1. Challenge our ethernal mindset. 
2. Understand the human diversity.
3. Learn expressing mismatches.
4. ...

## Ethernal mindset
As human beings (until some very special moment in our lives) we use to think and behave as we will live forever, our lives will never end (at least not in the nearest future), and everything that makes us strong, smart, agile, healthy, beautiful and so on - will stay with us.

We wanna challenge that filling of the eternal stability and immortality against universe forces.

Meanwhile some of the exercises might make you really depressed (so be careful!), and that filling of fragility doesn't really inspire, at the end you will become more focused and will get a more conscious view on the world and other people.

### Exercises

1. [The circle of Debunking](https://github.com/humanspectrum/spectralthinking/blob/master/module%20h/circleofdebunking.md) -- for the strongest ones.
