# Module H

The *H* module of the Spectral Thinking corpus is focused on personal usage of the methodology, and thus is all about humans, their attributes and their variability.

## Goals

1. Challenge our ethernal mindset. 
2. Understand the human diversity.
3. Learn expressing mismatches.
4. ...

## Ethernal mindset
As human beings (until some very specific moment in our lives) we use to think and behave like we will live forever, our lives will never end (at least not in the coming future), and everything that makes us strong, smart, agile, healthy, beautiful and so on will stay with us. 

We wanna challenge that filling of the ethernal stability. 

Meanwhile some of the exercies might make you really depressed (so be careful!), and that filling of fragility doesn't really inspire, at the end you will become more focused and will get a more conscious view on the world and other people.
