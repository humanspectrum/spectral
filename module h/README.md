# Module H

The *H* module of the Spectral Thinking corpus is focused on personal usage of the methodology, and thus is all about humans, their attributes and their variability.

## Goals

1. Challenge our ethernal mindset. 
2. Understand the human diversity.
3. Learn expressing mismatches.
4. ...

## Ethernal mindset
As human beings (until some very specific moment in our lives) we use to think and behave like we will live forever, our lives will never end (at least not in the coming future), and everything that makes us strong, smart, agile, healthy, beautiful and so on will stay with us. We wanna challenge that filling of the ethernal stability. Meanwhile some of the exercies might make you really depressed (so be careful!), and that filling of fragility doesn't really inspire, at the end you will become more focused and will get a more conscious view on the world and other people.

### Exercises

#### 1. The circle of Debunking.

Instruction:

1. Take a list of paper and a pen. 
2. Write down 4-5 personal attributes that make you unique or that are core part of you character or personality.
3. In 2 minutes per each attribute: write down some realistic events that might lead you to loosing your abilities or will make them irrelevant or not so unique.
4. Reflect on the events list. How you live would change if that really will happen? Are you able to prevent or matigate them?

Example:

1. I'm good at composing the big picture. -> Event: there is a narrow time constraings, that excludes processing all the information.
2. I 2m tall. -> Event: broke my legs, height doesn't matter. Event: moved to a country of tall people like Netherlands.

Group variation (recommended): 
3. Pass the list with attributes to the next person. Get similar list from the previous one.
4. In 2 minutes: each member of the group writes down the ideas for their current list. No repeats are allowed.
5. Repeat. Finish when you get your list back.
