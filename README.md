# Spectral Thinking

## Definition

Spectral Thinking (ST) is a set of patterns and tools for your personal and collective thinking process. Spectral Thinking focuses on capturing the diversity and variability present in the world and developing engines to operate them.

## Goals and Motivation

Spectral Thinking is a research project focused on finding practical tools to operate two key concepts: human diversity and time-awareness. We develop ST in the context of the unrolling digital transformation, and cultural and social changes introduced by new technologies. 

Our ambitions are:
1. To explore the human perspective and to bring it back to the innovation equation.
2. To make discussions and reflections more time-aware to improve our ability to operate at an increased speed of changes.
3. To find new ways to work with the future considering the variability of possible trajectories.

## Origin 

Spectral Thinking is based on ideas of Inclusive Design. ST extends its concepts of mismatch and persona spectrum to make them even more subjective and time-aware. Like Inclusive Design, ST explores the human aspect of our reality, diversity of people and variability of their contexts.

Spectral Thinking is inspired by various practical schemas of exploring and defining platforms, technical ecosystems, innovation culture, and digital transformation. ST extends them through the prism of the human factor, considering the variability of the future and the idea of active trend attractors coming from the Rapid Foresight.

## Openness

The Spectral Thinking methodology is open and free. ST development is a community effort. We use GitHub to develop and store our tutorials, samples, templates, cards, etc. You are welcome to fork and contribute back or ask a question through the issues.

## Languages

We have a goal to keep all documents related to the Spectral Thinking bilingual. We use English and Russian as the primary languages. Not everything is translated literally; we try to choose explanations and definitions that better fit every language and culture. You are free to add your editing or translate to other languages as well.
